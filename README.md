# Project Ideas
## Introduction
During Units 6-8 you will be building a capstone project. In this exercise, you’ll spend some time generating ideas for what to build for your capstone project.

## Setup
Create a new Github repository called “project-ideas”.

On your machine, create a new file called ideas.txt.

## Brainstorm
Generare at least 5 compelling project ideas for web applications you would like to create. The web app should have a database, a back end, and a front end with at last 3-5 interactive web form features. You can feature data visualizations, searches, maps, or other interactive elements (or not).

During this stage, your “idea” can be fairly general and informal. You don’t need to provide a lot of detail for each idea– a single bullet point for each idea should be sufficient.

### Tips for generating ideas
Make a list of hobbies and interests, and then use that to structure your brainstorming

Make a list of daily activities, and then use that to structure your brainstorming

Make a list of problems you would like to solve

Ask a friend or family member for ideas for an app they had

Go use a few of your favorite/most used websites and look for inspiration for something you’d like to build

Once you have at least 5 ideas that are exciting/interesting to you, continue on to the next section.

## Turn In Your Work
Add and commit ideas.txt to your project-ideas Github repository. Make sure that the repo is marked as “public” or shared directly with your program manager.

## Next Steps
Over the course of the next few days, narrow down these ideas to one or two final ideas. At the end of the week, you will submit your idea and MVP (you will work on this later this week) to the gauntlet channel in your specialization server.
